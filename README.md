# P-P2
These are some coding projects for Project/Portfolio 2. Some work fine and others need improvement.

Exercise 1 gives a list of items. The user then selects what they want to do such as alphabetize the list.
Exercise 2 acts a clue game for a user. It gives clues for a set item and they must type in what they think it is.

Exercise 3 contains students and their grades for a class. The admin user can select what to do, such as view student and grades or change information as needed.
Exercise 4 is a dictionary with some colors and facts about each color. The user can select a color and view the information about it.

Exercise 5 is just a variation of rock, paper, scissors against the computer.
Exercise 6 is a card game, which needs work. It is supposed to deal all cards evenly to 4 player, and each card is worth a certain amount of point. Player with most points wins.
The first code file is a time tracker app. It is connencted to a database that a user can store their daily schedules in and keep track of time spent on activities.

CodeFile 2 is a custom job search based app. It also connects to a database.
